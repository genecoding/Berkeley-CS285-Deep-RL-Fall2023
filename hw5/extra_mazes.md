## Bonus Problem
* I try extra mazes which are: 'FlyTrapSmall', 'Tree', 'Spiral11x11', 'FlyTrapBig', 'Galton', 'Maze11x11', 'UMulti' and 'Tunnel'.
* I finetune IQL on these mazes and by the result divide them into 3 groups, each has a set of hyperparameters. I also run DQN for comparison.
* Mazes in the 3rd group are more complex and the randomness is fixed in this homework, so the agent might not perform well at the last evaluation,
  so I train it longer and pick some good evaluations over the training.
* I had also finetuned CQL and AWAC on these mazes, some results look good and some need more finetune; since there are too many hyperparameters and I had already spent too much time on this,
  I decided to stop here.
